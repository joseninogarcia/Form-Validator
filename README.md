##Form Validator

###About

Form Validator is a jQuery plugin that validates the user's input. As of now, the version is 1 and I have only created this to make sure the next time I have another project, I can apply my code for verifying the input. Like I said, this is the first version of my plugin. I don't have much enough time so I decided to upload it in my github and alot of this I have to do for me to focus that relates to server side scripting. Anyway, back to what I was describing. This plugin helps the user just to check the form it is empty.
